# QA AI Dashboard - Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Phase 2 of the QA AI Dashboard project has been successfully implemented, focusing on the employee management system and enhanced recording upload functionality. This phase builds upon the foundation established in Phase 1, adding critical features for managing employees and associating recordings with specific employees.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Employee Management System

#### API Routes
- Created `/api/employees` endpoint for listing and creating employees
- Implemented `/api/employees/[id]` endpoint for viewing, updating, and deleting employees
- Added `/api/employees/[id]/recordings` endpoint for fetching employee recordings

#### UI Components
- Created `EmployeeForm` component for adding and editing employees
- Implemented `EmployeesTable` component for listing employees
- Built employee detail page with performance metrics and recordings tabs

#### Pages
- Updated `/dashboard/employees` page to list employees with filtering and sorting
- Created `/dashboard/employees/new` page for adding employees
- Implemented `/dashboard/employees/[id]` page for viewing employee details
- Added `/dashboard/employees/[id]/edit` page for editing employees

### 2. Enhanced Recording Upload

#### API Routes
- Updated `/api/recordings` endpoint to include employee association
- Implemented S3 folder structure for employee recordings
- Added filtering by employee to recordings API

#### UI Components
- Created enhanced upload form with employee selection
- Added file validation and progress tracking
- Implemented QA criteria selection

#### Pages
- Updated `/dashboard/recordings/new` page with employee selection
- Enhanced recording detail page with employee information

### 3. S3 Storage Structure

- Implemented hierarchical folder structure:
  - `companies/{companyName}/employees/{employeeName}/recordings/`
- Created utility functions for generating proper S3 paths
- Added validation to ensure employees belong to the correct company

### 4. Access Control

- Implemented proper access controls based on user role and company
- Ensured users can only see employees and recordings from their own company
- Added validation to prevent unauthorized access to employee data

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Utilization

The implementation leverages the database schema created in Phase 1, particularly:

- `Employee` model for storing employee information
- `Recording` model with `employeeId` field for association
- `PerformanceMetric` model for tracking employee performance
- `QACriteria` model for evaluation standards

### S3 Integration

- Enhanced S3 integration to support the new folder structure
- Implemented proper path generation based on company and employee
- Added validation to ensure files are stored in the correct location

### Form Validation

- Added comprehensive validation for employee forms
- Implemented file type and size validation for recording uploads
- Added error handling and user feedback

### UI/UX Improvements

- Created intuitive forms with proper validation feedback
- Implemented responsive tables with filtering and sorting
- Added progress indicators for file uploads
- Enhanced navigation between related entities (employees and recordings)

## Next Steps

With Phase 2 complete, the system now has a solid foundation for employee management and recording association. The next phase will focus on:

1. Enhanced analytics and reporting
2. Team management and collaboration features
3. Advanced QA scoring and feedback mechanisms
4. Bulk operations for recordings and employees
5. Integration with external systems

## Conclusion

Phase 2 has successfully delivered the core employee management functionality and enhanced recording upload process. The system now provides a comprehensive solution for managing employees and their recordings, with proper organization and access controls. This sets the stage for the advanced analytics and collaboration features planned for Phase 3.
