# QA AI Dashboard - Implementation Summary

This document provides a high-level summary of the implementation plan for the QA AI Dashboard project, with references to the detailed implementation documents.

## Project Overview

The QA AI Dashboard is a web application for quality assurance of audio recordings. It allows users to:

1. Upload audio recordings
2. Associate recordings with employees
3. Transcribe recordings using Assembly AI
4. Edit transcripts for accuracy
5. Analyze recordings using OpenAI
6. Generate QA reports based on manager-defined criteria
7. Track employee performance over time

The system has three role-based dashboards:
- **USER**: For regular employees who upload and analyze recordings
- **MANAGER**: For team leaders who define QA criteria and review reports
- **ADMIN**: For system administrators who manage users and system settings

## Implementation Phases

The implementation is divided into several phases:

### Phase 1: Database Schema and Authentication
*Detailed in: [QA_AI_Dashboard_Phase1_Implementation_Plan.md](QA_AI_Dashboard_Phase1_Implementation_Plan.md)*

- Database schema updates for companies, employees, and QA criteria
- Authentication system with admin approval workflow
- S3 folder structure for organizing recordings
- Admin dashboard for managing user registrations

### Phase 2: Employee Management and Enhanced Recording Upload
*Detailed in: [QA_AI_Dashboard_Phase2_Implementation_Plan.md](QA_AI_Dashboard_Phase2_Implementation_Plan.md) and [QA_AI_Dashboard_Enhanced_Recording_Upload.md](QA_AI_Dashboard_Enhanced_Recording_Upload.md)*

- Employee management API and UI
- Enhanced recording upload with employee association
- Bulk upload functionality
- Employee recordings page

### Phase 3: Transcript Editing and QA Criteria Management
*To be implemented*

- Transcript editing interface with speaker identification
- Timeline view with audio synchronization
- QA criteria management UI
- Criteria templates

### Phase 4: Report Generation and Analysis
*To be implemented*

- Enhanced analysis with employee-specific metrics
- Trend analysis for employees
- Comparative reporting
- Manager review workflow

## Key Components

### Database Models

- **User**: Authentication and role management
- **Company**: Organization structure
- **Employee**: Employee profiles and performance metrics
- **Recording**: Audio recordings and metadata
- **Transcription**: Transcribed text with editing capabilities
- **QACriteria**: Evaluation criteria for quality assurance
- **Analysis**: AI-generated analysis of recordings
- **Scorecard**: Performance scores based on criteria

### API Routes

- **/api/auth**: Authentication and registration
- **/api/admin**: Admin-specific functionality
- **/api/employees**: Employee management
- **/api/recordings**: Recording upload and management
- **/api/recordings/[id]/transcribe**: Transcription processing
- **/api/recordings/[id]/analyze**: Analysis processing
- **/api/criteria**: QA criteria management
- **/api/reports**: Report generation and management

### UI Components

- **Dashboard**: Role-specific dashboards
- **Employee Management**: Employee profiles and performance
- **Recording Management**: Upload, transcribe, and analyze recordings
- **Transcript Editor**: Edit and annotate transcripts
- **QA Criteria Builder**: Define evaluation criteria
- **Reports**: View and export QA reports

## Implementation Approach

1. **Database First**: Start with database schema changes
2. **API Development**: Implement API routes for each feature
3. **UI Components**: Create reusable UI components
4. **Page Integration**: Assemble pages using components
5. **Testing**: Test each feature thoroughly
6. **Deployment**: Deploy to production

## Next Steps

After completing the current implementation phases, future enhancements could include:

1. **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning for performance prediction
2. **Integration Capabilities**: CRM, LMS, and calendar integration
3. **Mobile Experience**: Mobile app for on-the-go report reviews
4. **Automated Coaching**: AI-generated coaching recommendations

## Getting Started

To begin implementation, follow these steps:

1. Set up the development environment
2. Apply database migrations from Phase 1
3. Set up the initial admin user
4. Implement the authentication system
5. Proceed with employee management and recording upload features

Refer to the detailed implementation documents for specific instructions for each phase.
