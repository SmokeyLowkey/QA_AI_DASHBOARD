# QA AI Dashboard - Phase 2 Implementation Plan Summary

## Overview
Phase 2 of the QA AI Dashboard project will focus on implementing the employee management system and enhancing the recording upload process with employee association. This builds upon the foundation established in Phase 1.

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. Employee Management System

#### API Routes
- Create `/api/employees` endpoint for listing and creating employees
- Implement `/api/employees/[id]` endpoint for viewing, updating, and deleting employees
- Add `/api/employees/[id]/recordings` endpoint for fetching employee recordings

#### UI Components
- Create `EmployeeForm` component for adding and editing employees
- Implement `EmployeesTable` component for listing employees
- Build employee detail page with performance metrics and recordings

#### Pages
- Update `/dashboard/employees` page to list employees
- Create `/dashboard/employees/new` page for adding employees
- Implement `/dashboard/employees/[id]` page for viewing employee details
- Add `/dashboard/employees/[id]/edit` page for editing employees

### 2. Enhanced Recording Upload

#### API Routes
- Update `/api/recordings` endpoint to include employee association
- Create `/api/recordings/bulk` endpoint for batch uploads
- Implement S3 folder structure for employee recordings

#### UI Components
- Create enhanced upload form with employee selection
- Implement bulk upload functionality
- Add recording filters by employee

#### Pages
- Update `/dashboard/recordings/new` page with employee selection
- Enhance recording detail page with employee information

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the employee management API routes
2. Implement the employee form and table components
3. Build the employee management pages
4. Update the recording upload form with employee selection
5. Enhance the recording API to include employee association
6. Test the complete employee-recording workflow

## Technical Considerations

- Ensure proper access controls based on user role and company
- Implement S3 folder creation for new employees
- Add validation for employee data
- Create audit logs for employee-related actions
- Optimize database queries for performance

## Timeline

Phase 2 implementation is expected to take approximately 2-3 weeks, with the following breakdown:

- Employee Management API: 3-4 days
- Employee UI Components: 3-4 days
- Employee Pages: 2-3 days
- Enhanced Recording Upload: 3-4 days
- Testing and Refinement: 2-3 days

## Success Criteria

- Users can create, view, update, and delete employees
- Employees can be associated with recordings
- Recordings can be filtered by employee
- S3 folder structure properly organizes recordings by employee
- Performance metrics are tracked by employee
